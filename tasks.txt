First task - Create a github repository for the exercises. Create a branch called "first-task". Download the repository locally. Commit and push this file in the branch "first-task".
Once done, continue with the rest of the tasks - keep in mind that each task shouold have a seperate branch. Example - second task should have a brach "second-task" and this is where you will push the second task only. Same goes for the third.
